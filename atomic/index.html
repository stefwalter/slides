    <section data-background-video="ostree-upgrade.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
			Atomic uses rpm-ostree to create ostree repositories out of RPMs. Cockpit
			shows you the what's currently installed as well as gives you option to rollback to a previous state. We can also check for new versions, see what packages will
			be changed and deploy those changes. Updates are always atomic so if the operation
			is canceled or interrupted in anyway the running system is not effected.

    <section data-background-video="ostree-upgrade-part-2.webm">

			Skipping ahead the host will reboot into the new version. You can reconnect and see that the upgrade is complete.

    <section>
		<h2><strong>Fixing RPM OSTree</strong></h2>

		<aside class="notes">
			Building this UI required making non-trival changes to rpm-ostree itself. This is a pattern we've seen several times actually where working on cockpit interface for a tool or service helps uncover issues that user will run into whether cockpit was a thing or not. Building out the UI really helps it take the next step from toolbox to product. In this case fixing these issues not only allowed cockpit to deliver a nice easy way for user to upgrade their systems but also performing the same actions from the terminal are now safer and easier to reason about.
		</aside>
    </section>

    <section data-background-color="white">
        <img src="upgrade-non-idempotent.png">
		<aside class="notes">
			One of the main issues was that rpm-ostree operations were not idempotent. It wasn't possible to be sure exactly what changes you were deploying. What exact version got deployed was racy. This could be a problem for multiple machines trying to upgrade in sync or even on a single machine you couldn't be sure that the exact changes you carefully preview are in fact what will be deployed.
		</aside>
    </section>

    <section data-background-color="white">
        <img src="deploy-idempotent.png">
		<aside class="notes">
			The solution was to add a new verb deploy that would allow you target a specfic version or hash if you prefer. Cockpit can show those RPM change diffs with confidence and ensure that only those changes are deployed when the user applies them.
		</aside>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><strong>Multi-User Safety</strong></h2>
 		<aside class="notes">
			The rpm-ostree command was not safe for multiple users. Users couldn't know what others were doing on the system and could end up with a corrupted system if certain actions were performed at the same time. Locking was added as an ostree primitive to prevent potentionaly corrupting concurent actions.
	    </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
       <h2><strong>DBUS API</strong></h2>
 		<aside class="notes">
			A DBUS API was added to rpm-ostree that made it possible to provide information on the status of the system as well as the ability to react to changes made elsewhere. It also had the added advantage of allowing cockpit to provide a detailed look at potentional changes without resorting to screen scraping.

		<h2><em>Containers<br>and Cockpit</em></h2>
        	<aside class="notes">
			Switching topics to container management. Last year we added a Kubernetes/Openshift UI in Cockpit.

			Quick review: Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that handles
			scheduling and management of docker containers. Openshift is built on top
			of Kubernetes and provides additonal deployment, orchestration, and routing
			functionality.

		    Just for the sake of simplicity instead of saying kubernetes / openshift everywhere
		    I'm just going say kubernetes, unless i'm refering specifically to features
		    only in openshift.
		</aside>
    </section>

    <section data-background-video="kube-features.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
            <p>Alright lets take a look at the UI itself. Let's start by uploading a simple service. This is a pretty useless mock service that does nothing but say hello. Once deployed we can see details about our objects.</p>

            <p>Pods are what kubernetes schedules and manages. A pods is one or more containers. We can inspect our pods, see details about the container it contains, follow the logs and even execute commands.</p>

            <p>Replication Controllers are how Pods are managed and handles scheduling them on available nodes.</p>

            <p>Since pods come and go, services define a set of pods that can be accessed in a stable way, even when the underlying pods change. We check on a services status, where it is located and what it exposes.</p>

			<p>Cockpit also provides some nice visualization to help admins see what objects are running and how they relate to and interact with each other. You can even make changes from this view and see it react.</p>

    <section>
	    <h2>Make it a <em>container</em></h2>
   		<aside class="notes">
   		    <ul>
   		    <li>So now that we have this UI we wanted to really eat our dogfood and run this UI seperate from the rest of cockpit as a pod in kubernetes. Enter the cockpit/kubernetes container.</li>
   		    <li>
		    The cockpit/kubernetes container looks at environment varibles to know how
		    to connect to the kubernetes master. When running as pod most of what it needs
		    will be automatically populated by the downward API and default secrets.</li>

		    <li>However when doing OAuth with openshift, there are two required variables
		    that right now can't get filled in by the downward API, The public domain or
		    address of the kubernetes master, and the public address or domain that we will
		    use in our browser to access our service.</li></ul>
		</aside>
    </section>

    <section data-background-video="oc-create.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
		    <ul>
            <li>Lets look at how this gets deployed on openshift. Openshift has a nice template feature that lets you create API object definitions from a template. We can use this to generate the object definitions our cockpit kubernetes service with the correct environment variables filled in.</li>
		    <li>We can pipe these definitions to oc create to actually create the objects.</li></ul>
		</aside>
    </section>

    <section data-background-video="kube-login.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
		    Now lets hit our newly deployed service in the browser. Right away we get
		    redirected to the our kubernetes master api server. I've configured this one
		    to login users using github as the OAuth provider. So we get redirected to
		    github, logged in and redirected back.

		    You can see this doesn't look like the standard cockpit, that's because we are
		    running just the kubernetes componant none of cockpits other system administration
		    packages are available since this is running in a unpriviledged container
		    isolated from the host system they wouldn't even make sense in this context.
		    To make all this work we refactored cockpit's local login mechnism to make it
		    pluggable, hopefully that will enable more interesting uses of cockpit's componants
		    in the future.`

        <section data-background-video="kube-kill.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
            Just to reiterate that we are running in a pod in kubernetes. Here's what it looks like if you kill the kubernetes pod we are running in. First we delete the replication controller so that we don't get respawned, and then delete the pod. It takes a moment for kubernetes to kill the pod, but when it does we are disconnected and can't reconnect.
		    <ul>
		    <li>While this mostly works, it isn't as smooth as it could be. There aren't a lot of integrated UIs successfully delivering in this way. Openshift's webconsole doesn't run as a pod, and while it's registry sort of does, it requires some non-standard integration to get it going.</li>
            <li>I won't get into all the details now but I did want to highlight a couple</li>
            <li>Discoverable external urls: Right now to make OAuth work we have to manually specify what the public urls for our UI service and the kubernetes api master are. Kuberenetes already knows the master URL so we really shouldn't have to specify that again, but more that that it would be ideal if there was a way to communicate better about external domains / addresses so we don't have to repeat ourselfs and specify those manually.</li>
            <li>Better authentication defaults: On openshift origin, the default is to accept any username/password combo. While our container will run with that, it's probably not a good idea to actually deploy anything like that. There is a cool orign PR by Stef to allow system users to authenticate with the kuberenete API, that might make a good default. On kubernetes the api is open by default, our container will refuse to log a user into an open api. So right now to use this with a standard kubernetes install you need to use basic auth. There's been some talk upstream about bringing in some of openshift's OAuth code into kubernetes. That would help make this more usable out of the box.</li>

	<section data-background-video="dbus-proxy.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>Let's look at some examples, here's the hostnamed call we made earlier. We are typing javascript code directly in the interactive console in a
				browser. If you have Cockpit running on your system try this.</li>

				<li>It's trivial to interact with the DBUS API, easier even than if you
				were on the system itself issueing gdbus commands... but that's the point ... we are on
				the system ... logged into the system ... and the javascript code
				here is running as part of the login session.</li>

				<li>This is what got me excited about Cockpit. The very idea
				that there was code in the browser interacting directly with the system
				cutting through the usual layers of crap ... really makes building
				admin tools fun again.</li>

				<li>And of course it works both ways, changes made via the command line tools update the api and those changes are picked up by the cockpit UI in the browser.</li>
            </ul>
		</aside>

	<section data-background-video="spawn-process.webm">

			<ul>
				<li>Let me show you another example. Spawning a process. Here's a single
				line of code that spaws a process in the Cockpit session. I'm spawning
				ping.</li>

				<li>Notice how the output streams back, this allows us to react to it in real time.</li>

	<section data-background-video="gtk-broadway.webm">
		<aside class="notes">
			<ul>
				<li>You can even do some pretty wild things like running GTK apps. This
				is broadway, and these apps are really running in the browser. GTK
				supports HTML5 based rendering, and Cockpit provides the login
				session and authentication to wrap it all together. Note that we aren't talking to the broadway websocket directly from the browser. The messages are flowing the way we saw earlier. From the browser to cockpit-ws to the bridge and then on to the broadway websocket. This is just an
				example, but I hope it proves the point.</li>
